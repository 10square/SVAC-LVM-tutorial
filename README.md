# SVAC-LVM-tutorial
This repository provides the material for a workshop on latent variable modeling (LVM) applied to the sexual violence in armed conflict dataset ([SVAC](http://www.sexualviolencedata.org/)).

The organization of this repository follows [HRDAG's](https://hrdag.org) [principled data processing guidelines](https://hrdag.org/2016/06/14/the-task-is-a-quantum-of-workflow/). This includes the use of [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to facilitate the self-documentation of our workflow. To run a Makefile from your command line, navigate to the relevant task repository (e.g., "$: cd ~/git/SVAC-LVM-tutorial/import/") and execute "$: make -f Makefile".
